## xdebug
```shell
XDEBUG_SESSION_START=netbeans-xdebug
```
For cli with remote host
```shell
export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=netbeans-xdebug remote_host=10.0.3.1"
```

Xdebug's default port (9000) conflicts with FastCGI (Xdebug was first!) - the solution is to change it to another port. After having done that, you need to restart your IDE where you will also need to configure the new port. You will also need to restart PHP and your Web Server.

## Ssh alias
```
Host myproject1.dev.myorganizations.com
  HostName myproject1
  User myUser
```
